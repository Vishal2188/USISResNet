To test/reproduce results, change "option/test/test_ntire1.json" file in which you need to change path for dataset and pre-trained model of G network.
Then you need run following command.
python test.py -opt option/test/test_ntire1.json

(pre-train model is shared in main folder named "11600_G.pth")

You can find "latest_G.pth" model which is pre-trained network for QA assessment trained on KADID dataset as mentioned in the manuscript.

Required Packages.
pytorch 1.4
opencv 3.4.2
python-lmdb 0.96
